**This a Public Repistory for Alpha_Vantage Code** 

**Instructions on how to install the alpha_vantage module and the API Documentation can be accessed here ==> https://github.com/RomelTorres/alpha_vantage**

**You have to sign up for and use your own API key if you are planning on using the scripts in this repistory. Free API keys are limited to 5 calls per minute, so it might not be great to run script2.py and attepmt to call all of the S&P 500 with a free API key (unless you perhaps use python's built in time module to ensure you never make more than 5 per minute).**
